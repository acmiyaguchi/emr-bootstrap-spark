    Bug 1390332 - Analysis clusters generally have a short lifespan and are
    not used in a multi-tenant fashion. However, a resource pool under a
    fair-scheduling policy enables sharing resources between short and long
    running queries. See the related job scheduling documentation for
    configuring pool properties.
